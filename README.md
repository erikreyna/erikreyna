## Hi friends

I am a software engineer and leader with a track record of delivering high-quality software products and leading teams. In 10 years of working in high-pressure newsrooms, I've fostered collaborative, high-performing environments and shipped software that helps The Washington Post deliver its most compelling visual and data-driven storytelling.
