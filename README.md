## Software Engineer and Leader

I am a software engineer and leader with a track record of delivering high-quality software products and leading teams. In 10 years of working in high-pressure newsrooms, I've fostered collaborative, high-performing environments and shipped software that helps The Washington Post deliver its most compelling visual and data-driven storytelling.

- I most recently worked on a lot of Elections related software, from ETL pipelines to front end, truly the full-stack experience.
- Ask/Tell me about my/your favorite places to go snowboarding. I got bit by the bug when I lived in Wyoming and now I can't stop thinking about hitting the slopes.
- If you need to contact me, drop me a line at public@erikreyna.com
- Fun fact: the most basic fact really, I play guitar (bass, electric, acoustic).
